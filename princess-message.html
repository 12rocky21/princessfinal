    <h1>To my Princess who acts tough 💖👑💖👑
    </h1>

    <p>
Happy Princess day to daddy's little princesss (here daddy means your daddy),
Ik princess bolna we agreed on not saying that but aaj keliye sunloo :) 
Tbh i really missed you badly on 18th November, i didn't know that it was princess day but when i found out, i wanted to text you, send you alot of reels but you told me not to text you anywhere so held my emotions there

I know you must not have expected me to do anything like this after how's everything been going, but the truth as i see is that its not YOU vs ME here, rather it's US vs THE SITUATION, so no matter what is happening you deserve to be called a princess, i can see how strictly you're following what your parents have told, tbh if you were my daughter, i would have been damn proud of you, i am proud of you and thank you for opening the website, honestly i was anxious if you'll be able to open the website or not....if you  can, you can save the url  of the website and  keep it as you see fit.

How's life going? 
Hope you're getting the princess treatment you deserve, it hurts me that i'm not there as per the current situations to pamper you with the princess treatment but i hope you are doing well!

Of course you are God's precious princess and Your father's little princess so i don't have anything to be worried of!
Hope college  and everything is going well for you!
Hoping to talk to you soon  once God gives  us an opportunity  to talk....

Just wanted to say, i know situation is not favourable,  i have seen your efforts when you could do and  maybe situation is not favourable for us to talk now, but i'm hoping when it'll be one day, we can both  continue on the same page again
I'm sorry if my actions made you feel  that i didn't trust you but honestly i do, i mean i can without any fear give you my phone, ik that's not a suitable example to show trust but yeah i do trust you...

Hope this makes your day a bit better, keeping you in prayers and hope God's will is being fulfilled in your life. 

I do realise how hard it must have been for you, when things got tough at home, i also was not able to support you properly, and you had to go through everything alone this time, i am sorry to not have been there for you...
But hats off to you, even when things were tough, your smile never went away, amidst everything balancing spiritual life, health issues, college pressure, family pressure and the pressure i am giving you, you are doing a good job handling everything, and in the midst of it, you are trying to listen to me as well on Sundays in the way that's possible for you currently, thank you for that!

Just a note: i  do notice you everytime  when you're present, even when i don't come to talk, i still notice you ..... :)

I understand you might not be in a position to take any action but still trying to lead your life in God's will is a decision i respect, so keep on hanging there!
It's only one life we got, so live to it's fullest! 😁

HAPPY PRINCESS DAY AGAIN, ik it's on November 18th but you are a princess everyday so yeah :)

Here are some reels & posts that i wanted to share, do take a look, once you can and maybe you can save this website's URL if you want:
